--- Music Display ---
by GabeHasWon

A simple mod that shows the currently playing music on-screen when the music changes.
This has support for all vanilla tracks, alongside support for other mods to add in their own.
As a developer for the Spirit Mod, all of Spirit's tracks have support for this already.

I will likely add more config and more customization in the future, but for now it's a simple little thing.
Enjoy!

-- Compatibility --

Adding compatibility is simple.
Adding a track is as follows: 

//Where display == MusicDisplay's Mod instance
display.Call("AddMusic", (short)MusicLoader.GetMusicSlot(Mod, "path/to/music"), "title", "subtitle");

This gives the given track a display of

	Current Music
		Title
	  Subtitle

For a further example, this is the code used in Spirit: 

	public override void PostSetupContent()
	{
		if (!ModLoader.TryGetMod("MusicDisplay", out Mod display))
			return;

		void AddMusic(string path, string name) => display.Call("AddMusic", (short)MusicLoader.GetMusicSlot(Mod, path), name, "Spirit Mod");

		AddMusic("Sounds/Music/GraniteBiome", "salvati - Resounding Stones (Granite Theme)");
		//Repeat for every track in the mod
	}
